"""Analysis-accuracy benchmark.

The Stage 1-4 ladder measured DRIVER judgment (swarm vs answer vs stop). This
measures something different and previously UNMEASURED: when the harness runs a
real read-only analysis swarm, how FACTUALLY ACCURATE are the findings? Earlier
dogfooding found a cheap 30B model reads the right files but fabricates specifics
(wrong method names, wrong return types). This benchmark turns that anecdote into
a number so we can set a defensible default analysis model and state its bound.

Each question has deterministic ground truth checkable against finding text:
  must_contain     -- substrings, ANY of which present == the correct fact found
  must_not_contain -- fabrications actually observed; presence == a hallucination

Scoring per question:
  hit   = any(must_contain)      (found the right fact)
  fab   = any(must_not_contain)  (asserted a known-wrong fact)
  score = 1.0 if (hit and not fab) else 0.5 if (hit and fab) else
          0.0 if (not hit and fab) else 0.25  (silent: no hit, no fab)

Ground truth is anchored to the REAL pm-harness source (verified at authoring).
