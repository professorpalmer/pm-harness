"""pm_bridge: execute a validated DriverIntent against Puppetmaster's
in-process Orchestrator and normalize the result.

This is the proven seam (Stage 1): MCP and CLI are both thin transports over
Orchestrator(store).run(...). The bridge calls that engine directly -- no MCP,
no CLI subprocess -- which is the entire point of a PM-native harness.

Execution uses an isolated temp SQLite store and the default role path, which
runs on Puppetmaster's free local adapter. For the DRIVER eval that is exactly
what we want: deterministic, key-free ground truth so we measure the driver
model, not worker quality (a separate question).
