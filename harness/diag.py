"""One lightweight place for failures we deliberately swallow.

The rig degrades gracefully in a lot of spots -- a fetch fails, we fall back to
cache; a cache write fails, we carry on. That resilience is correct, but
``except Exception: pass`` also makes the *reason* vanish, which turns "why is my
model list empty?" into an unanswerable question. This module keeps the graceful
fallback while making the discarded cause inspectable, without pulling in a
logging framework or changing any control flow.

Stdlib-only. Never raises: diagnostics must not become a new failure mode.
