"""Command execution policy: timeout resolution + danger classification.

PM-free and pure so it unit-tests fast and hermetically (AGENTS.md: the intent/
policy layer stays execution-free). Two responsibilities:

1. resolve_timeout(): how long a shell command may run. Hermes lets you turn
   timeouts off; we mirror that via HARNESS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT (seconds; 0 or
   "none"/"off" => unbounded). Default stays 120s so a fresh full-auto session
   cannot launch an unbounded remote command out of the box.

2. classify_command(): screen a shell command for irreversible or remote-reaching
   operations BEFORE execution. In full-auto (unattended) mode the harness pauses
   on a DANGER verdict and requires human approval -- the safety Hermes gets from
   its interactive destructive-op confirmation, which an autonomous loop otherwise
   lacks. In interactive co-working the human already sees every command, so the
   guard only bites in auto-mode.

The classifier is intentionally conservative: it flags by PATTERN, accepts that it
will sometimes flag a benign command (a false positive costs one approval click),
and never tries to "sanitize" or rewrite a command -- it only labels it.
