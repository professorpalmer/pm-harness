"""In-process edit engines for run_implement / run_parallel.

Two engines, one normalized result (:class:`harness.worker.WorkerResult`), so the
downstream apply/review/checkpoint pipeline never has to care which one ran:

* ``agentic`` -- Puppetmaster's first-class, provider-agnostic adapter. Runs its
  own tool-use loop directly against a provider HTTP API on the user's own key
  (no external agent CLI), with the router picking a right-sized model among the
  providers the keys unlock. This is the standalone default whenever a provider
  key is present. We run it inside an isolated worktree and capture the diff, so
  edits never touch the live repo until the normal review/apply gate passes --
  identical isolation to the native engine.
* ``native`` -- Marionette's own pilot (:class:`ConversationalSession`) driven
  inside the worktree. Richer toolset (run_command, tests, codegraph, web) and
  the automatic fallback when no provider key is available.

Engine selection is provider-key-aware and overridable via ``HARNESS_EDIT_ENGINE``
or an explicit adapter on the action. The dispatcher falls back from agentic to
native only when agentic genuinely cannot run (no key / router could not pick a
model) -- never when agentic ran and simply produced no changes.
