"""pm-harness product core: the PM-native harness.

This is the productization of the validated research (pmharness/). The Session
drives Puppetmaster's Orchestrator in-process via a swappable open-weights
driver, with a budget and REAL artifact feedback (not eval fixtures). The
DurableState read layer is what the GUI renders.

Driver default: glm-5.2 (MIT, efficient, 100% on the discriminating eval).
